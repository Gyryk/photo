# Photography
## Simple website to show some of my favourite clicks
Something I often do for fun, is going out on trips to new places and taking a bunch of photos of everything <br>
This website currently shows some of my favourite photos from my most recent trips <br>
- I've noticed the load times on the website are abysmal, working on a fix
  <br>
### I hope you like the pictures I took and the unique way I chose to show them

> I'm considering changing the background instead of moving pics around, so that you have a clearer view of the photos <br>
> I might add clicks from other trips as well in the future, the only problem is that photography is just another hobby
